* TODO teacher rating can have multiple related classes
  
Some raters will put things like Econ102/103 to say they took a class
with the teacher twice.

* TODO class levels should be parsed & fixed
  
Classes are just strings and attached to the department of the teacher
the ratings were scraped from, but could be parsed and normalized
better

* TODO front end interface
  
* TODO multi-threaded scraping
  
Can speed up scraping by hitting multiple pages at once

* TODO grade predicting
  
* TODO track scraped pages in database

- only scrape pages that haven't been scraped in a certain number of
  days to avoid rescraping the same pages over & over.

- maybe store checksum of page

- if a checksum differs all related "paged" ratings pages will be
  invalidated & need rescraping
