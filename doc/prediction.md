## WEKA

WEKA is a sweet tool for data mining and machine learning. There are
other potential tools, but I know this the best.

WEKA-Dev offers newer algorithms found in 3.7+

- [Handling Large Data Sets with Weka](http://wiki.pentaho.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=15991130)
- [SGDText](http://wiki.pentaho.com/display/DATAMINING/SGDText),
  Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm that works natively with
  textual data. Online & can be iteratively updated & trained as new
  data comes in.

## Modeling

We will need to source some actual grade data/transcript data to learn
from. Friends, classmates, ourselves, etc.
